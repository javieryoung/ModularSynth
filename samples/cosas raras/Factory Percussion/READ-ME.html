Samples by Gary Gehiere, a.k.a. Astral ProjectionEmail: ggehiere@golden.netPlease visit my web page: www.golden.net/~ggehiere/pixelpressThe factory.environmentals samples were originally made in December 1997 from cassette recordings, which is pretty obvious by the sound quality. I've had great results using these samples in ambient/ industrial music, and some of them are pretty good played an octave lower than the recording pitch: very liquid and bassy. I don't apologize for the sound quality. You're the pro, fix it or work with it. Try a little delay or something ;)
